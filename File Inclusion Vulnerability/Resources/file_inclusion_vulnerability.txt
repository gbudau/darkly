We notice there is a possible file inclusion vulnerability in the page parameter of the index.php file:
http://$IP/index.php?page=some-parameter

After some testing, and with the help of the popup, we find the flag after accessing the following URL:
http://$IP/index.php?page=../../../../../../../etc/passwd

NOTE: Aside from the file inclusion vulnerability, the way we access to unwanted files is similar to how we would perform a path traversal attack

Fixing file inclusion and path traversal vulnerabilities

# File inclusion

The most effective solution to eliminate file inclusion vulnerabilities is to avoid passing user-submitted input to any filesystem/framework API.
If this is not possible the application can maintain an allow list of files, that may be included by the page,
and then use an identifier (for example the index number) to access to the selected file.
Any request containing an invalid identifier has to be rejected, in this way there is no attack surface for malicious users to manipulate the path.

# Path traversal

We can prevent path traversal vulnerabilities through proper server configuration, for example:
- Disabling directory listing
- Serving content only from a public directory
- Setting a root directory and not allowing access outside of it.
