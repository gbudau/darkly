We notice there is a cookie set with the value

I_am_admin:"68934a3e9455fa72420237eb05902327"

We search for what hash is used and find is MD5 and the plain value is "false"

We generate a MD5 hash for "true" and change the cookie value to:

I_am_admin:"b326b5062b2f0e69046810717534cb09"

After refreshing the page we get a popup with the flag.

Mitigating authoization bypass via cookie tampering

Do not expose resource authorization on the client side in a way that allows any user to manipulate their own permissions. These actions must always be handled on the server, correctly managing user roles and permissions.

The way to fix this is that, once the admin user is authenticated, they should be given a cookie containing a unique identifier. This cookie should be included in each request made by this user in order to validate their role and access to authorized resources on the server.

There are many options:
- session cookies
- signed JWT
