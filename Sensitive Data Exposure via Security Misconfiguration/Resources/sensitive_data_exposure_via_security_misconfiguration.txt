We look for the existence of robots.txt file which helps search engines to decide which paths in our site can be crawled. And find:

User-agent: *
Disallow: /whatever
Disallow: /.hidden

At /robots.txt we look inside /whatever path and going there we find an publicly accessible htpasswd file with the following content:

-----------<NOTA> Completar informaci√≥n sobre robots.txt y htpasswd------------------------

root:437394baff5aa33daa618be47b75cb49

`htpasswd` file is used to protect access to restricted files and routes inside Apache servers. 

We identify the hash as MD5 with the value qwerty123@

With this discovered credentials, we realize there is an /admin path asking for a username and password

We login at /admin with username root and password qwerty123@ and get the flag

Mitigating this attack sensitive data misconfiguration:

Review the server configuration to deny access to these files, avoid placing sensitive files in public directories, and above all, do not add sensitive paths to the robots configuration.
