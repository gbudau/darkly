We find an /admin path asking for a username and password

At /robots.txt we find there is a /whatever path and going there we find an publicly accessible htpasswd file with the following content:

root:437394baff5aa33daa618be47b75cb49

We identify the hash as MD5 with the value qwerty123@

We login at /admin with username root and password qwerty123@ and get the flag
