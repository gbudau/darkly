We notice there are some redirects for social media sites, for example http://192.168.1.131/index.php?page=redirect&site=twitter

We change the url to http://192.168.1.131/index.php?page=redirect&site=something

And we get a flag.

Fixing bypass access control checks vulnerability

- Do not trust client-modifiable inputs to access sensitive resources
- Have an allow list of sites we trust that the user can navigate to using this mechanism.
- If we donâ€™t have an allow list, instead of forcing a redirect through a query parameter, link to the sites directly using anchor tags.

This vulnerability falls into Broken Access Control: https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/
